// The credential library, proven end-to-end (007): gate a purchase with a CUSTOM

//   npm run build:packages                    # build the two @openmobilehub/credentagent-* packages
//   node examples/professional-license.mjs    # → http://localhost:3007/mcp
//
// This is the worked pack for issue #19: a `professional_license` gate defined inline
// with `defineCredential({ id, request, verify, effect, ui })` — no registration step —
// and dropped into the same ordered policy array as the built-ins. Unlike the older
// `custom-credential.mjs` (which showed a custom gate RESOLVING into the manifest), this
// gate is served by the MOUNTED ceremony from its OWN request/verify and ENFORCED on the
// shared completion path: an order with the licensed item cannot complete until the
// license is proven — on every payment rail, not just the rendered page (invariant 1).
//
// The generalization is what makes this real: the credential-gate rail no longer knows
// only "age" | "membership" — it serves ANY credential the policy registers, and
// `completeOrder` sweeps every applicable `gate()` credential (re-derived from the
// re-priced order — invariant 2) and refuses one that isn't proven (per order — invariant 4).

// ── Honest scope (Principle VII) ──
// trust_level is "presence-only-demo" on every surface: the wire crypto is real
// (WebAuthn / OpenID4VP JWE + nonce binding / ISO-mdoc parse), but there is NO issuer /
// device-signature trust anchor yet, so a self-crafted mdoc would pass. This gate
// enforces DISCLOSURE + BINDING + COMPLETION, not TRUST — never present a
// "professional license" card as a real safety control until issuer-verified trust
// lands (#14). Multi-instance note: the rail + completion learn a custom credential from
// `requirements()` (register-on-resolve), so a split deployment must resolve the policy
// once at startup on every instance (definitions are code; only state is shared).
